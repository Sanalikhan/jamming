# 🎧 Jamming

A React single-page application that integrates with the Spotify Web API, allowing users to:

- **Search** Spotify’s music library
- **Create & modify** playlists
- **Authenticate** via Spotify OAuth
- **Save** custom playlists to their Spotify account

## 💡 Features

- **Search Songs**: Query track names in real time
- **Build Playlists**: Add/remove tracks from your custom playlist
- **Save to Spotify**: Use OAuth to authenticate and save playlists directly
- **Playlist Editing**: Rename playlists and update content before saving

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** – component-based UI
- **Spotify Web API** – search, playlists, saving
- **OAuth** – Spotify user authentication
- **CSS / Responsive Design** – clean and user-friendly interface


## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo at terminal
   git clone https://github.com/Sanalikhan/jamming.git
   cd jamming
   Install dependencies
   npm install
   Create a Spotify app and set redirect_uri to http://localhost:3000/
   Add your credentials in src/util/spotify.js:

   const CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID';
   const REDIRECT_URI = 'http://localhost:3000/';
   Run in development mode
   npm start
   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Authenticate with Spotify and start building your playlist!

✅ How It Works
Authenticate: User logs in via Spotify OAuth flow

Search: User enters track keywords → API fetches results

Modify Playlist: Add/remove tracks locally

Save: Send playlist data to Spotify to create a playlist on user’s account

🔧 Why Jamming?
I built this to explore integrating external APIs, mastering OAuth flows, and practicing state management in React. It’s a fun and interactive way to remix playlists!
